## Abstract
The &mu;-opioid receptor (μOR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and the target of most clinically and recreationally used opioids. 
The induced positive effects of analgesia and euphoria are mediated by μOR signalling through the adenylyl cyclase-inhibiting heterotrimeric G protein Gi. 
Here we present the 3.5 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the &mu;OR bound to the agonist peptide DAMGO and nucleotide-free Gi. 
DAMGO occupies the morphinan ligand pocket, with its N terminus interacting with conserved receptor residues and its C terminus engaging regions important for opioid-ligand selectivity. 
Comparison of the &mu;OR–Gi complex to previously determined structures of other GPCRs bound to the stimulatory G protein Gs reveals differences in the position of transmembrane receptor helix 6 and in the interactions between the G protein α-subunit and the receptor core. 
Together, these results shed light on the structural features that contribute to the Gi protein-coupling specificity of the &mu;OR.
