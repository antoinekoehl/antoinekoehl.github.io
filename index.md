I'm Antoine! I got my Ph.D. in Structural Biology from Stanford University in [Brian Kobilka's lab](https://med.stanford.edu/kobilkalab.html) where I studied G Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) activation and signaling.
I'm currently a [Miller Fellow](https://miller.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley, hosted by [Yun S. Song](https://http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/) in the Statistics Department.
My current research focus is on using machine learning to answer questions about the evolution of function in protein families (with a focus on GPCRS) as well as to help guide the development of novel tools.
