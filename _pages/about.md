## About me
I received my Ph.D. in Structural Biology from Stanford University in [Brian Kobilka's lab](https://med.stanford.edu/kobilkalab.html) where I studied G Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) activation and signaling.

I'm currently an NIGMS K99/R00 Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley, jointly advised by [Yun S. Song](https://http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/) and [David F Savage](https://www.savagelab.org). I was previously a [Miller Fellow](https://miller.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley, hosted by [Yun S. Song](https://http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/) in the Statistics Department.

My current research focus is on using machine learning to answer questions about the evolution of function in protein families (with a focus on GPCRS). I view machine learning as a powerful tool to solve challening problems in biology.
