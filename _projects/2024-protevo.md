This project sought to extend classical models of protein Evolution (LG, WAG) using deep neural networks.
Classical models of protein evolution assume that sites evolve independently.
On the other hand, protein language models (e.g. ESM) are great at capturing dependencies between sites, but are unable to describe evolution along a tree, or the time aspect of evolution.
We bridge this divide and create a model that inherits the best of both worlds - it can model evolution between sequences along a tree, and can capture dependencies between sites.
