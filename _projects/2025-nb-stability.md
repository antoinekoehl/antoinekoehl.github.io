Antibodies are a key class of therapeutic proteins, but their development is often hindered by poor stability and solubility.
In this project, we created a new assay to measure the folding fitness of millions of antibody variants in parallel.
These variants encompassed radically different CDRs within the context of a defined framework - and allowed us to measure the impact of CDR sequence on antibody stability.
